Lab Exercises
Can you identify whether the teachers' Rating data is a time series or cross-sectional?
Print out the first ten rows of the data

Does it have a date or time variable? - No - it is not a time series dataset
Does it observe more than one teacher being rated? - Yes - it is cross-sectional dataset
The dataset is a Cross-sectional

Create a histogram of the beauty variable and briefly comment on the distribution of data
using the matplotlib library, create a histogram

pyplot.hist(ratings_df['beauty'])
(array([16., 51., 94., 66., 94., 42., 29., 40., 11., 20.]),
 array([-1.45049405, -1.10844234, -0.76639063, -0.42433892, -0.08228722,
         0.25976449,  0.6018162 ,  0.94386791,  1.28591962,  1.62797133,
         1.97002304]),
 <a list of 10 Patch objects>)

here are few conclusions from the histogram most of the data for beauty is around the -0.5 and 0 the distribution is skewed to the right therefore looking at the data we can say the mean is close to 0

Does average beauty score differ by gender? Produce the means and standard deviations for both male and female instructors.
Use a group by gender to view the mean scores of the beauty we can say that beauty scores differ by gender as the mean beauty score for women is higher than men

ratings_df.groupby('gender').agg({'beauty':['mean', 'std', 'var']}).reset_index()
gender	beauty
mean	std	var
0	female	0.116109	0.81781	0.668813
1	male	-0.084482	0.75713	0.573246
Practice Questions
Question 1: Calculate the percentage of visible minorities are tenure professors. Will you say that tenure status differed if teacher was a visible minority?
## insert code here
### we can use a groupby function for this
## first groupby to get the total sum
tenure_count = ratings_df.groupby('minority').agg({'tenure': 'count'}).reset_index()
# Find the percentage
tenure_count['percentage'] = 100 * tenure_count.tenure/tenure_count.tenure.sum()
##print to see
tenure_count
minority	tenure	percentage
0	no	399	86.177106
1	yes	64	13.822894

Question 2: Does average age differ by tenure? Produce the means and standard deviations for both tenured and untenured professors.
## insert code here
## group by tenureship and find the mean and standard deviation for each group
ratings_df.groupby('tenure').agg({'age':['mean', 'std']}).reset_index()
tenure	age
mean	std
0	no	50.186275	6.946372
1	yes	47.850416	10.420056

Question 3: Create a histogram for the age variable.
## insert code here
pyplot.hist(ratings_df['age'])
(array([41., 37., 58., 48., 75., 74., 53., 69.,  0.,  8.]),
 array([29. , 33.4, 37.8, 42.2, 46.6, 51. , 55.4, 59.8, 64.2, 68.6, 73. ]),
 <a list of 10 Patch objects>)

Double-click here for the solution.

Question 4: What is the Median evaluation score for tenured Professors?
## insert code here
## you can index just tenured professors and find their median evaluation scores
ratings_df[ratings_df['tenure'] == 'yes']['eval'].median()
4.0
